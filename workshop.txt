description=A character with the "Not a Picky Eater" trait doesn't experience negative emotional effects (boredom and unhappiness) from eating. Ever. Dog food, tomato paste, stale bread, a rotten apple, a burnt steak, a dead rat -- food is food! Don't let it go to waste.

description=A character with the "Refined Palate" trait is a true connoisseur trapped in the culinary hellscape that is the apocalypse. Negative emotional effects from eating are boosted by 50%, anything cooked in a microwave is boring, and many low quality foods that would otherwise be neutral or positive -- candy, chips, canned food, etc. -- make them unhappy.
